## Typography

### Serif

	- Emulates calligraphy
	- Journalism & historical
- Transitional
	- Strong, stylish and dynamic
	- Sharper serif
	- Legal and academic
- Modern
	- Structured, clear and elegant
	- Art and culture
- Egyptian
	- Boxy serif
	- Authoritative and friendly
	- Marketing and promotion

### Sans-serif

Any font that does not contain a serif.

- Humanist
	- Emulates calligraphy
	- Tension between perfect and imperfect
	- Government & educational
- Transitional
	- Unassuming and modern
	- Technology and transportation

### Script

### Other Considerations

- Don't use Comic Sans. Ever.
- Don't choose two fonts from the same style (i.e. two humanist serif fonts) or class (i.e. two serif fonts)
- Do combine fonts with a similar trait (i.e. one humanist serif font and one humanist sans-serif font)
